# Capstone Project #2: E-Commerce Platform Deployement with Git, Linux, and AWS 

## Project Scenario 

I was assigned to develop an e-commerce webstite for a new online marketplace named `MarketPeak.` The platform will feature product listings, a shopping cart, and user authentication. I am expected to utilize Git for version control, develop the platform in a Linux environment, and deploy it on an AWS EC2 instance. 

## Objectives 
1. Repository implementation 
2. Working with Git: branch, staging, commit, and pushing. 
3. Website implementation from templates in a Linux environment and deploying on AWS EC2.

## Step 1: Setting up the Repository.

### Tasks: 
1. Still working with my centralized repository `Darey.io_DevOps_Project`, I made a new diretory and named it `02.MarketPeak_Ecommerce` to follow my naming convention.

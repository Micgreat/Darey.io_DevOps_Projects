## Scenario
`A development team tasked to enhance a website`

### Tools
1. Git
2. VS code


### Tasks
1. I cloned a repository locally.
2. Created 4 files in the main branch using nano (home.html, about_us.html, events.html and contact_us.html) and added contents to them.
3. I staged, commited and pushed to the main branch.
4. I setup a new branch for another user (Morgan) and have her create new files (book_reviews.html). The files were staged, committed and pushed.
5. Repeated the steps above for Jamie. 
6. Created a pull request and merged.
